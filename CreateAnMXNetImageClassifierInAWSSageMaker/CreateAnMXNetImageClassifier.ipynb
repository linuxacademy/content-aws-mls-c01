    "# Frameworks\n",
    "For this lab, we will be using Apache MXNet to build and train a model to classify images, and specifically take advantage of the Gluon API provided with MXNet to make that process really easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MXNet\n",
    "\n",
    "A flexible and efficient library for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MXNet provides optimized numerical computation for GPUs and distributed ecosystems, from the comfort of high-level environments like Python and R.\n",
    "- MXNet automates common workflows, so standard neural networks can be expressed concisely in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Source: https://mxnet.apache.org/)_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gluon\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the the Gluon API specification, the Gluon library in Apache MXNet provides a clear, concise, and simple API for deep learning. It provides basic building blocks for neural networks that make it easy to prototype, build, and train deep learning models without sacrificing training speed. Install a recent version of MXNet to get access to Gluon.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have bricks. Lots of bricks. LEGO bricks, that is. And we need to sort them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a collection of photos of various LEGO bricks from different angles. We have 600 photos (which probably took us more time to collect than sorting the current bricks) and they are all labeled with the brick type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each photo has been processed. This involved increasing the contrast, sharpening, removing the color, inverting the colors, and reducing the size.\n",
    "\n",
    "|![Sample LEGO brick photo](./sample-before.png)|![Sample LEGO brick photo](./sample-after.png)|\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to this, we stored all the images into data arrays for easier loading into the notebook. These are stored in the `lego-simple-mx-train` and `lego-simple-mx-test` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create a simple, deep learning, neural network classifier model. We will train the model using the photo data and see if it correctly predicts the type of a brick from a supplied test image."

You could simply execute the notebook to get a result, but that's not really very hands-on and it won't teach you anything but how to execute cells in a Jupyter notebook. To get the most from this lab, you should understand what the code in each cell is trying to accomplish, and then take the time to experiment: make changes, break it, fix it, and learn! You can always pull the code down again to get a clean copy."

    "I got an accuracy of about 95%. Your model might be slightly higher or lower. For your actual problem (sorting the blocks), is approximately 95% accuracy good enough for you? Are you willing to have about 1 in 20 of your bricks in the wrong place for the advantage of not having to manually decide which type of brick you are sorting? That's up to you! You can also analyze which bricks the model is consistently getting wrong and reorganize those bins yourself once the model is finished. Machine learning is just one tool and one option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the rest of your lab time to experiment with the model architecture to see if you can improve on your current accuracy. Try using another random seed. You can also change the number of training epochs, but be careful not to overfit your model!"
