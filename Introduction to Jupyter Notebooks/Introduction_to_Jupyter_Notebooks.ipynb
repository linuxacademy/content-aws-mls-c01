    "A group of scientists have travelled to Antartica to carry out a penguin survay.  During the survay they collect the heights and weights of a number of penguin.  Using this data the project wants us to create a (simple) machine learning algortythum to help predict the weights of penguin given thier height.   This is not as simple as you might think!  Bone and feather density as well as diet mean that different penguins of the same height could weight different amounts.  So we need to analyses all the data and come up with a model that fits as best we can.\n",
