    "A group of scientists have traveled to Antartica to carry out a penguin survey. During the survey, they collect the heights and weights of a number of penguins. The project wants us to use this data to create a (simple) machine learning algorithm to help predict the weights of penguin given their heights. This is not as simple as you might think! Penguins of the same height may weigh differnet amounts because of factors like diet, bone density, and feather density. So we need to analyze all the data and create a model that fits as best we can.\n",
